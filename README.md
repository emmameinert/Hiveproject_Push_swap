# Push_swap

Push_swap is an introduction to the world of numbers and algorithms.
Using a certain set of operations it aims to sort numbers with only two stacks.

## My approach

## Operations

sa/sb - Swaps the first 2 elements at the top of stack a/stack b. 

pa/pb - Takes the first elemt of b and puts it on top of stack a/from a to b.

ra/rb Shift up all elements of stack a/b by 1.

rra/rrb: Shifts down all elements of stack a/b by 1.

rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

ss : sa and sb at the same time.

rr : ra and rb at the same time.
